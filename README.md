# ASIF_Quadcopter

This repo aims to implement an Active Set Invariance Filter (ASIF) on a simulated quadcopter.

It is derived from https://github.com/abhijitmajumdar/Quadcopter_simulator (credited where due)

## Requirements
The simulator was last tested on Python 3.7.4 on Windows 10. It requires the following Python packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Optional: To save the simulator animation as an mp4 or gif, you will need to install ![ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
